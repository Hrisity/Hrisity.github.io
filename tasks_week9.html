            <h2>Week 9 IL Activity</h2>
            <h3>Analysing Digital Video</h3>
            <h4>Task 1: Analyse the use of video on the web</h4>
            <p>Once again, I have decided to work with the Flux Academy’s website, since it is a website similar to the
                one I’m working on.</p>
            <p>What the Videos are Used For: The videos on the website are used primarily for educational purposes. They
                offer tutorials, tips, and insights into web design, user experience, and digital media. It is important
                to note that the target audience of Flux’s website and mine are quite alike. What is more, interviews
                with industry professionals, case studies, and reviews of design tools and software can also be found on
                the website.</p>
            <p>Evidence of Video Used with Intent: Educational videos are commonly structured to enhance comprehension
                and retention by breaking down complex concepts into digestible segments. In this case, by using visual
                aids, and providing practical examples. Also, I find the real-world examples and step-by-step tutorials
                great for learning new concepts. This might be appealing to an even wider range of viewers.</p>
            <h4>Things to consider when creating content for my website:</h4>
            <p>Advantages: The dynamic way to learn that videos offer makes it easy for people with different learning
                styles. A key factor is the combination of visual and auditory elements since they offer a more engaging
                learning experience. For example, one can pause at any time, and take notes if necessary, or even go
                forward and back, if they missed something.</p>
            <p>Disadvantages: The positive outcomes I just discussed depend entirely on the quality, presentation, and
                relevance to the audience. If done poorly, the video content might make viewers leave.</p>
            <p>Suitability of Video Length: the ideal length of educational videos varies. However, they should be
                edited in a way that maintains viewer engagement, and at the same time provides enough information on
                the topic.</p>
            <p>Combination of Video with Other Media: Often, even in the videos on the Flux Academy website, videos are
                complemented by other media like text and audio. This is a combination I am planning to add to the final
                version of my website.</p>
            <h4>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of video content</h4>
            <p>I’m planning to create videos that are my work. For example, using screen records, and using animations
                done in the software, when using audio, I will make sure that is copyright-free and added to the
                reference list.</p>

            <h2>Week 9 - Lab activity</h2>
            <h3> Editing digital video</h3>
            <h4>Task 1: Optimise your video for Web use</h4>
            <p>For this task, I’m using Final Cut Pro on my computer.</p>
            <p>Step one: Become acquainted with the video editor</p>
            <p>I have been using this video editor for years, and I believe that I am already acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>Step two: I’ve imported the files I will be using for the video I am editing.</p>
            <p>Step three: Trim and split clips</p>
            <p>For this task, I first split the video and trimmed it to fit my project’s length.</p>
            <p>Step four: Add Text, Motion & 3D Effects, and Filters</p>
            <p>As you will see, my final video features text, motion, and some effects. I achieved this with the help of
                the video editor I chose to work with. </p>
            <p>Step 6. Export your video project in three qualities</p>
            <p>I have exported the video in three qualities:</p>
            <h4>High (1080p): </h4>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
                <source src="video/ChatGPT_step1_1080p.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>Medium (720p):</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
                <source src="video/ChatGPT_step1_720p.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>Low (480p):</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
                <source src="video/ChatGPT_step1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>

            <p>Task 2: Exploring alternative options</p>
            <h4>Step one: Try alternative methods of editing and optimisation</h4>
            <p>More videos will be added to the different sections of my final website. They will be edited using
                alternative methods of editing and optimisation</p>
            <h4>Step two: Present my findings</h4>
            <p>High (1080p): The resolution is 1920x1080 pixels. This is a high-definition (HD) quality that offers
                sharp, and clear images. It’s perfect for large screens and detailed visuals. It consumes more data
                because of the higher resolution. This means that a faster internet connection will be required to
                stream the content.</p>

            <p>Medium (720p): The resolution is 1280x720 pixels. This quality is what I consider decent. It offers good
                clarity. In fact, it is also considered HD, but with less sharpness. The data it consumes is moderate -
                a balance between quality data usage. It is suitable even for a slow internet connection. It looks well
                on smaller screens like smartphones or tablets. The reduced resolution is almost unnoticeable on these.
            </p>

            <p>Low (480p): The resolution is 640x480 pixels or similar. This is a standard definition (SD) quality that
                offers less sharpness. It uses minimal data, so it is ideal for a very slow internet connection. It
                works well for small screens.</p>
