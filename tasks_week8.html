			<h3>Analysing Digital Audio</h3>
            <h4>Task 1: Analyse the use of audio on the web</h4>
            <p>Although I’m not the biggest fan of websites containing audio, I actually found the website <a href="https://gehry.getty.edu" target="_blank">“Getty”</a> quite impressive and made me even consider adding audio to my website.</p>
            <p>This website uses audio primarily in the form of background music. The music pieces one hears when going through the website are classical compositions performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and other notable musicians, aligning with the theme of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. These compositions include works by Dvořák, Mozart, Mahler, Saint-Saëns, and Rachmaninoff​.</p>
            <p>The use of classical music as background audio on the website enhances the user's comprehension, retention, and appeal by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing Information Comprehension and Retention: The way in which music selection and content complement each other is impressive. This reinforces the theme of the Walt Disney Concert Hall as a space dedicated to classical music. This harmony between audio and visual content aids in helping people understand and remember the presented information.</li>
                <li>Increasing Appeal: I believe that classical music creates an immersive and emotionally engaging experience for the user, which in terms further enhances the appeal of the website's content.</li>                
            </ul>
			<p>However, there are a couple of things to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first thing that somehow makes me avoid adding audio to my website is accessibility: Users with hearing impairments or those browsing in sound-sensitive environments might miss out on the full experience.</li>
                <li>Another thing is User Preference: Some users might find background music distracting or may have different musical tastes, which could impact their experience negatively. I can always put a turn on/off button, yet not everyone will be getting the same experience, which is something that I always avoid when building websites.</li>                
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, the multimedia approach to combine audio with other media like images, text, and video to create a holistic multimedia experience makes the content more engaging and memorable for users, who enjoy classical music. In this case, I really admire the pairing of the visual content of Frank Gehry’s architectural work with classical music performances associated with the Walt Disney Concert Hall.</p>
            <h4>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content</h4>
            <p>I’ve had a look at the audio options I have on <a href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music?page=1&filters[]=Calm&type=free&sort=relevance&category=Mood" target="_blank">bensound</a>, and found a couple that I can use either as a background sound, or as part of a video tutorial that I am planning to provide on the website. Here is the list of audio files I liked:</p>
            <p>1.Enigmatic:</p>
            <p>Music: Bensound</p>
            <p>My License Code: O97MTREXLCTZJHOP</p>
            <audio controls style="width: 300px; height: 50px;">
                <source src="audio/enigmatic.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
              </audio>
            <p>2.Love:</p>
            <p>Music: Bensound</p>

            <p>3.Piano Moment:</p>
            <p>Music: Bensound</p>
            <p>My License Code: 0MDLKDV2OJ36RUPZ</p>
            <audio controls style="width: 300px; height: 50px;">

			<h3> Editing digital audio</h3>
            <h4>Task 1</h4>
            <p>Step one: I have installed and opened Audacity.</p> 
            <p>Step two: Crop an audio file.</p>
            <p>In this step, using Audacity I cropped the audio file by first zooming in enough that I see the peaks and troughs of the sound wave. With the selection tool, I selected the part I wanted to keep and then trimmed the audio to selection.</p>
            <p>Step three: Export optimised audio files</p>
            <p>I have exported the audio file in the WAV format, by following the steps: File > Export > Export as WAV signed 16-bit PCM, then I moved on to exporting my sound in the MP3 format in a similar way.</p>
            <audio controls style="width: 300px; height: 50px;">
                <source src="audio/love_first_edit.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
              </audio>
            <p>I created three derivatives in the MP3 format:</p>
            <p>One MP3 derivative in Medium (Trimmed version of "Love") (145-185 kbps) quality, Joint Stereo</p>
            <audio controls style="width: 300px; height: 50px;">
                <source src="audio/love_joint_stereo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
              </audio>
            <p>One MP3 derivative in Standard (Trimmed version of "Love") (170-210 kbps) quality, Stereo</p>
            <audio controls style="width: 300px; height: 50px;">
                <source src="audio/love_stereo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
              </audio>
            <p>One MP3 derivative in Medium (Trimmed version of "Love") (145-185 kbps) quality, Forced export to mono</p>
            <audio controls style="width: 300px; height: 50px;">
                <source src="audio/love_mono.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
              </audio>
            <h4>Task 2: Exploring alternative options</h4>
            <h5>Step one: Try alternative methods of editing and optimisation</h5>
            <p>As with most audio editing software, Audacity provides a lot of options when it comes to audio editing. I managed to change the length of audio files, splitting them into parts, exporting them to different formats, also merging two separate audio files. Gaining knowledge about audio editing will not be helpful only for this project but also for others in the future.</p>
           <h5>Step two</h5>
           <p>The differences between the three files I exported is in the way they balance the size and quality of the audio and how they utilise audio channels. The joint stereo and stereo files provide a sense of spatial audio, important for music and some types of recordings. On the other hand, mono is more space-efficient and can be sufficient for simpler audio needs. In terms of bit rate difference, higher bit rates offer better quality at the expense of larger file sizes. </p>
