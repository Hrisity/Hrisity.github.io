			<h3>Defining my Audience</h3>
            <p>I managed to define my audience groups with the help of <a href="https://www.comm.pitt.edu/oral-comm-lab/audience-analysis" target="_blank">Audience Analysis</a></p>
			<h3>Audience groups</h3>
            <h4>Audience 1: Designers and UI/UX Professionals</h4>
			<p>Demographic Descriptors: The age group is primarily people between 20-45 years old but can vary. In terms of gender, there isn’t a specific leading gender. I think it’s a balanced mix of all genders. The education level of the individuals within this group is mostly a bachelor’s degree or higher in design-related fields. Geographically speaking, urban areas with access to technology hubs predominate.</p>
            <p>Why this audience?: The main target is designers and UI/UX professionals since they work directly with the tools and techniques that are directly related to UI/UX design. What is more, they are interested in keeping up with the latest trends and tools in the industry.</p>
            <p>Broad or Narrow Audience?: I can say that the audience is narrow since the people involved have a specific professional focus - design and user experience.</p>
            <p>Pre-existing Expectations: Although they are likely to be familiar with some design tools and techniques discussed on the website, the aim is to broaden their knowledge by exposing them to novel AI tools in the design industry and teaching them how to use in their future projects.</p>
            <p>Accessibility for User Testing: I believe that this specific audience will be actively engaging in professional online communities and forums, which will make it easier for me to gather feedback.</p>
            <h4>Audience 2: Developers Interested in UI/UX and AI</h4>
            <p>Demographic Descriptors: I reckon that the age group will be similar to the first audience group, roughly between 20-40 years old. However, when it comes to gender specifics, skews more male, but diversity exists. The members of this audience group have typically achieved a bachelor's or higher degree in computer science or related fields. Such individuals are often located in tech-centric regions; however, this may also vary.</p>
            <p>Why this audience?: Similar to the first audience group, developers with interests in UI/UX design and AI can benefit from the website content as they are seeking to explore the integration of AI technologies into their projects. They do not necessarily have strong design backgrounds but are willing to explore the field of AI in design.</p>
            <p>Broad or Narrow Audience?: It is a narrow audience since the target is a specific subset of developers interested in AI and design.</p>
            <p>Pre-existing Expectations: As developers, they may lack in-depth knowledge of UI/UX principles; yet they can expect to learn about incorporating AI in projects which involve working closely with designers.</p>
            <p>Accessibility for User Testing: Active communication in developer communities and forums may be helpful in engaging this audience for user testing may require some technical discussions.</p>
            <h4>Audience 3: Students and Newcomers to UI/UX Design</h4>
            <p>Demographic Descriptors: The members in this audience group are typically between 16-30 years old. The members of this group come from diverse genders. The education level also varies, individuals are from high school students to recent graduates with design interests. The geographical location has a vast range, and it is possible to reach a global audience.</p>
            <p>Why this audience?: The members of this group are willing to learn and enter the world of UI/UX design. They are constantly seeking for guidance to kickstart their careers.</p>
            <p>Broad or Narrow Audience?: This group is broad, in comparison to the two I discussed earlier. It involves all newcomers to UI/UX design with different levels of prior knowledge.</p>
            <p>Pre-existing Expectations: I think that the expectations of this group’s members are centred around introductory content and tutorials.</p>
            <p>Accessibility for User Testing: It will be more accessible. Possible ways for user testing are through educational platforms, blogs, etc. where students seek guidance.</p>
            <h3>Exploring the audience needs in relation to design</h3>
            <p>Before completing the task I explored the following methods:  <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/user-journey-map/#:~:text=A%20user%20journey%20map%20(also,long%2Dterm%20loyalty%20and%20advocacy" target="_blank">User journey mapping</a>, <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/web-design-11-characteristics-user-friendly-website" target="_blank">Social Media Today</a> and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-need-statements/" target="_blank">User need statements</a>. These helped me realise my audience needs in relation to design for each of the identified audience groups and consider how this might translate into multimedia content for my website design.</p>
            <h3>Audience needs</h3>
            <p>Their needs include good usability, mobile compatibility, good accessibility, well-planned information architecture,  effective navigation as well as browser consistency. Another important thing to consider is the colour scheme. In addition, downloadable materials such as design assets, templates, and plugins streamline their work for the designers, and project files and code examples for the developers would be a nice feature.</p>

            <h2>Week 2 Lab Activity</h2>
            <h3>Identify and evaluate websites</h3>
            <p>Selected websites for comparison:</p>
            <p>1.<a href="http://www.dokimos.org/ajff/" target="_blank">Dokimos</a></p>
            <p>1.<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov" target="_blank">White House</a></p>
            <p>I selected the two websites since they offer different opportunities for evaluation.</p>
            <p>Effectively Addresses a Topic (First Principles of Design Thinking): The first website lacks clarity in presenting the topic. An excessive use of colour, gifs, and cluttered design is noticed which, in this case, distracts from the core message. I find the layout and navigation poorly created. This results in information being scattered and hard to find. On the other hand, the website of the White House is designed with clarity in mind. It presents the topic in an effective way, thanks to its organised layout. The information is logically structured. This makes it easy for us, the users, to navigate and find what we need. Such a layout is something I am aiming to achieve when creating my portfolio website for this course.</p>
            <p>Offers Opportunities for Social Change, New Learning, and Experiences: The first website has a chaotic design that detracts from the user's ability to engage with the content effectively. I assume a user of this website is more likely to get frustrated by the design rather than inspired to interact or learn from it. However, the second website enhances the user's experience. The user can engage with the website content easily. Hence, they are likely to absorb information and take action on the presented topics.</p>
            <p>Contrasting Structure or Navigation: The first website’s navigation is unclear, with a noticeable overuse of animated gifs; as a result distraction is caused, and the user is misguided. While the second one has clear navigation guiding the user seamlessly through the content.</p>
            <p>Different Layout, Colours, and Graphics: In my honest opinion, the first website is visually overwhelming. Many colours are used, and the disorganised layout lacks contrast. The White House’s website has a modern design that I find visually appealing. It has a well-thought-out colour scheme, enhancing readability and engagement. Hence, this makes the website accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>Multimedia Choice and Quality: The use of gifs and poor-quality images and text in the first website, while in the second one, we notice high-quality images and multimedia elements that enhance the content.</p>
            <p>Types of Interaction: On website 1, limited elements for interaction are provided. Also,  the cluttered design and unclear navigation make it hard for any effective interaction at all. Website 2; however, provides effective interactive elements that encourage the user to engage and explore.</p>
            <p>The audience: It is challenging to identify a specific target audience for the first website as it is designed chaotically, and it is hard for me to identify the individuals who might find the website helpful or interesting. On the other hand, the second website is clearly aimed at individuals looking for information and resources about the White House and related events.</p>
