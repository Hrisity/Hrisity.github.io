			<h3>Defining my Audience</h3>
            <p>I managed to define my audience groups with the help of <a href="https://www.comm.pitt.edu/oral-comm-lab/audience-analysis" target="_blank">Audience Analysis</a></p>
			<h3>Audience groups</h3>
            <h4>Audience 1: Designers and UI/UX Professionals</h4>
			<p>Demographic Descriptors: The age group is primarily people between 20-45 years old but can vary. In terms of gender, there isn’t a specific leading gender. I think it’s a balanced mix of all genders. The education level of the individuals within this group is mostly a bachelor’s degree or higher in design-related fields. Geographically speaking, urban areas with access to technology hubs predominate.
                Why this audience?: The main target is designers and UI/UX professionals since they work directly with the tools and techniques that are directly related to UI/UX design. What is more, they are interested in keeping up with the latest trends and tools in the industry.
                Broad or Narrow Audience?: I can say that the audience is narrow since the people involved have a specific professional focus - design and user experience.
                Pre-existing Expectations: Although they are likely to be familiar with some design tools and techniques discussed on the website, the aim is to broaden their knowledge by exposing them to novel AI tools in the design industry and teaching them how to use in their future projects.
                Accessibility for User Testing: I believe that this specific audience will be actively engaging in professional online communities and forums, which will make it easier for me to gather feedback.</p>
            <h4>Audience 2: Developers Interested in UI/UX and AI</h4>
            <p>Demographic Descriptors: I reckon that the age group will be similar to the first audience group, roughly between 20-40 years old. However, when it comes to gender specifics, skews more male, but diversity exists. The members of this audience group have typically achieved a bachelor's or higher degree in computer science or related fields. Such individuals are often located in tech-centric regions; however, this may also vary.
                Why this audience?: Similar to the first audience group, developers with interests in UI/UX design and AI can benefit from the website content as they are seeking to explore the integration of AI technologies into their projects. They do not necessarily have strong design backgrounds but are willing to explore the field of AI in design.
                Broad or Narrow Audience?: It is a narrow audience since the target is a specific subset of developers interested in AI and design.
                Pre-existing Expectations: As developers, they may lack in-depth knowledge of UI/UX principles; yet they can expect to learn about incorporating AI in projects which involve working closely with designers.
                Accessibility for User Testing: Active communication in developer communities and forums may be helpful in engaging this audience for user testing may require some technical discussions.</p>
            <h4>Audience 3: Students and Newcomers to UI/UX Design</h4>
                <p>Demographic Descriptors: The members in this audience group are typically between 16-30 years old. The members of this group come from diverse genders. The education level also varies, individuals are from high school students to recent graduates with design interests. The geographical location has a vast range, and it is possible to reach a global audience.
                    Why this audience?: The members of this group are willing to learn and enter the world of UI/UX design. They are constantly seeking for guidance to kickstart their careers.
                    Broad or Narrow Audience?: This group is broad, in comparison to the two I discussed earlier. It involves all newcomers to UI/UX design with different levels of prior knowledge.
                    Pre-existing Expectations: I think that the expectations of this group’s members are centred around introductory content and tutorials.
                    Accessibility for User Testing: It will be more accessible. Possible ways for user testing are through educational platforms, blogs, etc. where students seek guidance.</p>

            <h2>Week 1 Lab Activity</h2>
            <h3>Setting up my file structure</h3>
            <p>During the week 1 lab activity, I first established the file structure that will help me keep track of any relevant to my website topic documents. I decided to organise my files as follows, in a folder on the web server - the HTML file, and separate folders containing multimedia assets such as photos, images, and articles. I have taken inspiration from <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=30361&seqNum=4" target="_blank">Organizing a Web Site's Files</a>, from <a href="https://www.informit.com/store/absolute-beginners-guide-to-creating-web-pages-9780789728951?w_ptgrevartcl=What+You+Need+to+Get+Started+Creating+Web+Pages_30361" target="_blank">the Absolute Beginner's Guide to Creating Web Pages, 2nd Edition (Stauffer, 2002)</a>.</p>
            <h3>Review of HTML</h3>
            <p>Before creating my portfolio website, I took some time to improve my HTML skills. For this purpose, I used resources such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVnjOPwW4ZA" target="_blank">Programming with Mosh</a> to prepare for the creation of my portfolio website.</p>

            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVnjOPwW4ZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h3>Creating my own HTML files</h3>
			<p>I've planned out the structure for my portfolio website. There's a menu on the homepage that allows visitors to access the tasks for week 1, week 2, and week 3, respectively. When selected each leads to a separate page presenting the independent learning and lab tasks related to that particular week. The purpose of this setup is to track the design thinking process behind my website’s building. </p>
			<p>Below the menu is the topic of my website, along with an introduction of the topic which can also be taken as an invitation to the designers visiting the website. After that, there's a navigation with sections leading to pages that provide information about the topic. Please, keep in mind that this is an early version of the website, so some of the pages within the navigation bar may still be under construction.</h3>
