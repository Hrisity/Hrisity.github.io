        <section id="introduction_to_ai">
            <p>Welcome to your first lesson on enhancing UX/UI design with AI tools. In this lesson, you will learn about Generative AI and get a refresher on UX/UI.</p>
            <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
            <p>On your journey towards successfully applying AI to your design workflow, it’s important to understand how generative AI works.</p>

<p>The type of AI we focus on in this online course is Generative AI. Why is it important? Well, first and foremost, that’s the AI technology capable of producing various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI" target="_blank">(Lawton, 2023)</a>. These, as you will see in your next lessons, are key elements for building our AI-enhanced design projects. Generative Artificial Intelligence is a significantly powerful technology that gained its popularity with the Open AI release of their product Chat GPT, which set the record for “the fastest-growing consumer application” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811723000289#bib18" target="_blank">(Lim et al., 2023)</a>.  Later on, the same company introduced DALL-E which instead of messages responds to the user’s prompt with images. What they have in common is that both are products of deep learning <a href="https://openai.com" target="_blank">(OpenAI, 2023)</a>. The power such tools give us is enormous. In a matter of seconds, we will be able to get high-quality text, graphics and videos and implement them right away in our projects.</p>

<p>In other words, Generative AI is part of machine learning that reflects how the human brain learns and responds to data <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deep%20learning%20applications%20in%20manufacturing%20operations%3A%20A%20review%20of%20trends%20and%20ways%20forward&publication_year=2023&author=S.%20Sahoo&author=S.%20Kumar&author=M.Z.%20Abedin&author=W.M.%20Lim&author=S.K.%20Jakhar" target="_blank">(Sahoo et al., 2023)</a>. It’s important to note that Generative AI can provide responses and generate content in those responses <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Alexa%2C%20what%20do%20we%20know%20about%20conversational%20commerce%20Insights%20from%20a%20systematic%20literature%20review&publication_year=2022&author=W.M.%20Lim&author=S.%20Kumar&author=S.%20Verma&author=R.%20Chaturvedi" target="_blank">(Lim, Kumar et al., 2022)</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of this learning journey, you will not only be familiar with AI terminology but also able to achieve amazing results using generative AI tools.</p>

            <h2>Revision of UX/UI</h2>
            <p>As designers and people interested in the field you most probably have heard of UX/UI. Now, let’s clarify what each means. Although they share similarities and many of you might specialise in both, they differ in terms of outcomes. UX is related to the ways users interact with the product and that is, in fact, the goal (Oleksandr, 2019). On the other hand, UI focuses on the elements that the user interacts with, layout, and visuals (Oleksandr, 2019).</p>
            <p>If you are at the beginning of your design journey, you can get started by learning the basics here:</p>
