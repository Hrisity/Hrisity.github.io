            <p>Welcome to my MAD(A) portfolio website! ðŸ‘‹ </p>
            <p>This is an early stage of my website providing an idea of how the final product should look, along with the tasks I have completed during weeks 1-3 while working on the independent learning and lab activities. Each weekâ€™s tasks are located in the menu at the top of the homepage. Simply click on the corresponding link for each week.</p>
            <p> The topic I have chosen for my project is â€œAI-Enhanced UI Design". The reason behind my topic is simple. Throughout the last couple of months, UX and UI design changed a lot. The reason for the recent shift is the introduction of many AI tools that are powerful enough to deliver products that previously could only be done by design professionals. Giants like <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/ai-the-next-chapter-in-design/" target="_blank">Figma</a>, <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/power-of-ai" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai.html#:~:text=We%20have%20developed%20and%20deployed,aligns%20with%20our%20company%20values." target="_blank">Adobe</a>, and <a href="https://www.framer.com/ai" target="_blank">Framer</a> are examples of design software that have successfully implemented such AI tools. Many designers are concerned about the future of their career path due to such developments.</p>
            <p>My goal was to create a website that helps individuals in the fields of UX/UI design, web design, and graphic design by providing educational materials on the latest trends, some tutorials, and information about the tools and novelties in the world of AI that could be beneficial for their future design projects. Everyone who is looking to enhance their design workflow is welcome. I am confident that my findings will be helpful to many people willing to gain knowledge in the field of AI in design. </p>
            <p>The current state of the website provides an idea of how the final product should look. My aim is to expand and develop the content section significantly by the deadline of submitting my final project. Each element within the content section is a subtopic of the main subject. By interacting with the buttons in the content section, the user will be able to navigate to specific pages, which will provide information, lessons, trends, or tool information. Currently, you see 3 subtopics. However, my plan is to have 10 pages covering various topics related to the main subject. After completing them the user should feel confident in their AI knowledge and be able to apply it to their future design projects.</p>
            <p>Enjoy the process!</p>
