        <p>Welcome to my MAD(A) portfolio website! ðŸ‘‹ </p>
        <p>This is a porfolio website that provides an preview of my final website, along with the
            tasks I have completed during weeks 1-11 while working on the independent learning and lab activities. Each
            weekâ€™s task is located in the menu at the top of the homepage. Simply click on the corresponding link for
            each week's page.</p>
        <p> The topic I have chosen for my project is â€œAI-Enhanced UI Design". The reason behind my topic is simple.
            Throughout the last couple of months, UX and UI design changed a lot. The reason for the recent shift is the
            introduction of many AI tools that are powerful enough to deliver products that previously could only be
            done by design professionals. Giants like <a

                href="https://webflow.com/blog/power-of-ai" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, <a
                href="https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai.html#:~:text=We%20have%20developed%20and%20deployed,aligns%20with%20our%20company%20values."
                target="_blank">Adobe</a>, and <a href="https://www.framer.com/ai" target="_blank">Framer</a> are
            examples of design software that have successfully implemented such AI tools. Many designers are concerned
            about the future of their career path due to such developments.</p>
        <p>My goal is to create a website that helps individuals in the fields of UX/UI design, web design, and graphic
            design by providing educational materials on the latest trends, some tutorials, and information about the
            tools and novelties in the world of AI that could be beneficial for their future design projects. Everyone
            who is looking to enhance their design workflow is welcome. I am confident that my findings will be helpful
            to many people willing to gain knowledge in the field of AI in design. </p>
        <p>The current state of the website provides a preview of the final product. My aim is to expand
            and develop the content section significantly by the deadline of submitting my final project. Each element
            within the content section is a subtopic of the main subject. By interacting with the buttons in the content
            section, the user will be able to navigate to specific pages, which will provide information, lessons,
            trends, or tool information. Currently, you see 3 subtopics. However, my plan is to have 10 pages covering
            various topics related to the main subject. After completing them the user should feel confident in their AI
            knowledge and be able to apply it to their future design projects.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the process!</p>
