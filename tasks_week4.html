			<h3>Review of CSS</h3>
            <p>Based on the mood board and the wireframe I created during the first 3 weeks I had an idea of how my final design should look.  Although I had some previous knowledge of CSS, I decided to go through some of the tutorials on  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. I find them quite helpful for both beginners and people who need to develop their CSS skills.</p>
			<p>After reviewing the CSS structure I took the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_quiz.asp" target="_blank">W3schools CSS quiz</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_exercises.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools CSS exercises</a>, I moved on to the actual lab task for this week - to create my external CSS sheet.</p>
            <p>This task has helped me enhance the overall design of my website, and I am proud to share my greatest achievement so far:</p>

            <h3>Lab Task 1 - Create my external CSS sheet</h3>
            <p>Since the first version of the portfolio website project (week 1-3) was still small, its CSS was included directly within the HTML file. However, I have now separated these, and the CSS sheet I have created, mystyle.css, is linked to my HTML file. I did the same for my separate pages' css sheets.</p>
            <h3>Lab Task 2 - Style my page</h3>
            <p>I have specified the colour palettes, and font families, and thought of a specific layout during the first three weeks of the course. Iâ€™ve decided to work with colours that are balanced enough in terms of contrast so that the content is easily accessible. The font I have chosen is Arial - an easily readable font. Another important feature was responsiveness. After looking through some tutorials I believe that I managed to create a website that is not only visually appealing but is also responsive, and people can access it through different screen size devices.</p>
