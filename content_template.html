            <h2>Week 1 IL Activity</h2>
			<h3>Choosing and preparing my website topic</h3>
			<h4>Task 1: Choosing my topic</h4>
            <p>In the beginning, I listed 6 possible topics that I am passionate about. The list featured: The Future of AI, AI and Automation in the Workplace, Ethical Considerations in AI, AI and Education, AI-Enhanced UI Design, and AI in Entertainment and Media.</p>
			<p>After taking some time to think, I made the decision to work on the topic “AI-Enhanced UI Design” for the following reasons. The topic covers aspects concerning designers such as the possibilities AI offers in creating smoother and more efficient user experiences. It opens possible discussions such as Future trends, news, challenges and solutions, as well as real-world applications.</p>
			<p>The objective is to give designers the opportunity to not only become familiar with the subject of AI, but also to be able to apply this knowledge and create User-Centric Designs. This approach will help designers to keep up with the latest industry trends and best practices, and will no longer perceive AI tools as a threat, but rather as an ally.</p>
			<h4>Task 2: Exploring the scope of the topic and narrowing down the focus</h4>
			<p>The people who can benefit from engaging with the topic discussed on my website are Designers and  UI/UX professionals who work with software like Figma, Webflow, Adobe Photoshop, and Framer. They are looking to keep up with the changes in the design industry. Developers looking to explore the potential implementation of AI in UI/UX projects can also benefit from the content provided on my website. In addition, students and newcomers to UI/UX design, web and graphic design, who are willing to learn, can benefit from the website's content.</p>

            <h2>Week 1 Lab Activity</h2>
            <h3>Setting up my file structure</h3>
            <p>During the week 1 lab activity, I first established the file structure that will help me keep track of any relevant to my website topic documents. I decided to organise my files as follows, in a folder on the web server - the HTML file, and separate folders containing multimedia assets such as photos, images, and articles. I have taken inspiration from <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=30361&seqNum=4" target="_blank">Organizing a Web Site's Files</a>, from <a href="https://www.informit.com/store/absolute-beginners-guide-to-creating-web-pages-9780789728951?w_ptgrevartcl=What+You+Need+to+Get+Started+Creating+Web+Pages_30361" target="_blank">the Absolute Beginner's Guide to Creating Web Pages, 2nd Edition (Stauffer, 2002)</a>.</p>
            <h3>Review of HTML</h3>
            <p>Before creating my portfolio website, I took some time to improve my HTML skills. For this purpose, I used resources such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVnjOPwW4ZA" target="_blank">Programming with Mosh</a> to prepare for the creation of my portfolio website.</p>

			<h3>Creating my own HTML files</h3>
			<p>I've planned out the structure for my portfolio website. There's a menu on the homepage that allows visitors to access the tasks for week 1, week 2, and week 3, respectively. When selected each leads to a separate page presenting the independent learning and lab tasks related to that particular week. The purpose of this setup is to track the design thinking process behind my website’s building. </p>
			<p>Below the menu is the topic of my website, along with an introduction of the topic which can also be taken as an invitation to the designers visiting the website. After that, there's a navigation with sections leading to pages that provide information about the topic. Please, keep in mind that this is an early version of the website, so some of the pages within the navigation bar may still be under construction, and the list of topics is not completed.</h3>
