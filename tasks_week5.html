			<h3>Review Professional Writing Characteristics</h3>
            <h4>Task 1: Review professional writing characteristics</h4>
            <p>In this task, I have read and considered the following professional writing characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy</li>
                <li>Active Voice</li>
                <li>Limit Bias</li>
                <li>Clarity</li>
                <li>Conciseness</li>
                <li>Conversational and smoothly flowing prose</li>
                <li>Correctness</li>
                <li>Parallelism</li>
                <li>Positive voice</li>
                <li>Strong nouns and verbs</li>
                <li>Sentence Variety</li>
                <li>Simple Words</li>
                <li>Shorter Paragraphs</li>
                <li>Tone and voice</li>

            </ul>
			<p>Reviewing them helped me realise the ways I can successfully deliver my messages to the website users.</p>
            <h4>Task 2: Evaluate resources</h4>
            <p>For this task, I have selected the Flux Academy’s website. It is a website that has a similar purpose to my website - to educate designers on how to effectively build websites. Here’s a <a href="https://www.flux-academy.com" target="_blank">link</a> to the website.</p>
            <p>Evaluating Flux Academy’s website against the fourteen professional writing characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The website’s content is accurate. The text is well-written and created with attention to detail.</li>
                <li>Active voice is used throughout the website.</li>
                <li>I cannot spot any limit biases within the website. No age bias, racial bias, or implicit bias can be noticed.</li>
                <li>The words used by the content creators are correctly used and can be recognised by the target audience - designers.</li>
                <li>Wordiness is avoided.</li>
                <li>The used language is simple. The sentences are not complex, they are easy to follow.</li>
                <li>I cannot spot any grammar errors, or words that are used poorly.</li>
                <li>Parallelism is used from time to time.</li>
                <li>A positive voice is used.</li>
                <li>The website offers a service. The nouns and verbs that are used are strong. They successfully do the job of selling the product.</li>
                <li>The sentences vary in sentence length combining short, medium and longer sentences.</li>
                <li>People from all around the globe access the website, and this is why recognisable words over showy words are used.</li>
                <li>We can notice short paragraphs that can easily keep the user’s attention.</li>
                <li>Correct tone and voice are used at all times.</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Task 3: The Awe writing process</h4>
            <p>Another thing that I will take into consideration when creating my website’s content is the Awe writing process. Three are the steps I need to follow. The first step is to Assess. This includes defining the audiences, defining the purpose, conducting research, which I already did, and organising, categorising & and outlining. The second step is to write - creating a draft and reading and revising. The last step is to edit my text. It involves checking for correctness and organisation and editing paragraphs and sentence levels.</p>

			<h3>Adapting textual content to your design needs</h3>
            <h4>Task 1: Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content</h4>
            <h5>Part 1:</h5>
            <p>In this task, I selected Flux’s ‘Standout portfolio in 7 days’ page for analysis with the volant tools.</p>
            <p>First, I inserted the <a href="https://www.flux-academy.com/courses/standout-portfolio-in-7-days" target="_blank">link</a> and pressed “reveal”.</p>
			<img src="images/voyant1.png" alt="voyant" width="700" height="400">
            <h5>Part 2:</h5>
            <p>My findings: This corpus has 1 document with 3,099 total words and 855 unique word forms. The most frequent words in the corpus are portfolio (43); design (37); program (34); work (29); and webflow (21). This page is about teaching people how Ito build their portfolio website, hence the high use of the words portfolio (43); design (37); and program (34) is understandable. It tends to catch the attention of the users.</p>
            <p>Here are the results presented in the different tabs:</p>
            <p>Cirrus tab:</p>
            <img src="images/voyant2.png" alt="voyant1" width="670" height="400">
            <p>Trends tab:</p>
            <img src="images/voyant3.png" alt="voyant2" width="670" height="380">
            <p>Bubblelines tab:</p>
            <img src="images/voyant4.png" alt="voyant3" width="670" height="180">
            <p>Part three: I believe that the combination of both the il activity and the work with the volant tools was helpful for the analysis of my resources. I’m planning on using both ways of analysis for my actual website.</p>
            <h4>Task 2: Create Samples of text</h4>
            <p>You can navigate to the <a href="introduction_to_ai.html" target="_blank">Introduction to AI section</a>, and find my first samples of text.</p>
            <p>If you follow the link I provided, it will take you to my first section which contextualises my topic. I am planning to include this opening statement in the first AI lesson on my website. With it, I believe that I have met the professional writing characteristics. I’ve paid attention to accuracy and used active voice. However, when explaining complex concepts based on academic sources, I may need to utilise the passive voice. I avoided biases, and negative tone at all times and tried to use recognisable words while avoiding wordiness. The language I used was simple and my paragraphs are short, at least, I tried to simplify it. I will continue to follow professional writing characteristics when building the final version of my website.</p>
